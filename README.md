# Gatsby Themes

This is a repo for [Gatsby's official themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-api/).

- `gatsby-theme-blog`
- `gatsby-theme-blog-core`
- `gatsby-theme-notes`
- `gatsby-theme-blog-darkmode`
- `gatsby-theme-ui-preset`

These themes are Gatsby sites packaged as plugins, which you can configure for your own use.

## Installation

Clone the repository and `cd` into it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes
cd themes
```

Install dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

## Development

Before getting started, make sure that you have [set up your local dev environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/setting-up-your-local-dev-environment/) and that youâ€™re on the latest version of `gatsby-dev-cli`.

You can start the `gatsby-starter-theme` workspace using `yarn start`. To work on the themes themselves, you can edit files in the `themes/packages` directory. For example, to change the blog theme's basic post template, you would open `themes/packages/gatsby-theme-blog-core/src/components/post.js`. These themes are then loaded via the Gatsby instance located in `starters`.

## Filing Issues and PRs

Please follow the [Gatsby contributing guidelines](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributing/how-to-contribute/).
